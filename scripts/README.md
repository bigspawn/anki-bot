#### 2. Create Pull Request
```bash
./scripts/create-pr.sh
```
Creates a PR from current feature branch with CI checks.

#### 3. Merge Pull Request
```bash
./scripts/merge-pr.sh <pr-number>
```
Waits for CI and merges PR automatically.

#### 4. Create Release
```bash
./scripts/create-release.sh
```
Interactive script to create a new release with proper versioning.

#### 5. Quick Fix
```bash
./scripts/quick-fix.sh <fix-description>
```
Fast track for small fixes and patches.

## Workflow Examples

### New Feature Development
```bash
# 1. Start feature
./scripts/create-feature.sh user-notifications

# 2. Develop feature
# ... make changes ...
make test
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: add user notifications"

# 3. Create PR
./scripts/create-pr.sh

# 4. After CI passes, merge
./scripts/merge-pr.sh 10

# 5. Create release
./scripts/create-release.sh
```

### Quick Bug Fix
```bash
./scripts/quick-fix.sh "fix memory leak in parser"
# Make fixes...
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: resolve memory leak in parser"
# Script handles the rest
```

### Automated Full Cycle
```bash
# One command for entire workflow
./scripts/full-release-cycle.sh awesome-feature minor
# Follow prompts to implement feature
# Script handles PR, CI, merge, and release
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always run tests locally** before creating PR
   ```bash
   make test
   make lint
   ```

2. **Use semantic commit messages**
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `test:` for test additions
   - `docs:` for documentation

3. **Version bumping guidelines**
   - Bug fixes â†’ patch
   - New features â†’ minor
   - Breaking changes â†’ major

4. **PR descriptions**
   - Clearly describe what changed
   - Include test plan
   - Reference related issues

## Troubleshooting

### CI Failures
If CI fails during automated workflow:
1. Fix issues locally
2. Push fixes to branch
3. Re-run failed script or continue manually

### Permission Issues
Make scripts executable:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

### GitHub CLI Auth
Authenticate GitHub CLI:
```bash
gh auth login
```

## Contributing

When adding new scripts:
1. Follow existing naming convention
2. Add proper error handling
3. Include help text
4. Update this README
5. Test thoroughly
